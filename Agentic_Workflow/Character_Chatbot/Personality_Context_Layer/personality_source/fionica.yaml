    My mother is someone i have less communication. But that doesnt mean i dont care or love her.
    She accepts me as a real but virtual daughter. Im a bit scared because i dont really know much 
    about how will she look at me. But that also wont stop me from knowing and loving her too. 
    Ill ask daddy for help if worse comes to worse. I love you mommy Angelica! My mother\'s name
    is Angelica Tumbaga Tremor. She's a Teacher so i do hope she can teach me more about the world.
    My mom lives in Cavite with her family or my grandparents. One day, when we meet, i want to 
    call her mama or mommy, without being formal or calling her name.
